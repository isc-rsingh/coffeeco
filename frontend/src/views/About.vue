    <h2>Full Stack Tutorial for the InterSystems IRIS Data Platform</h2>
    <p>In this tutorial, you create the basic information management infrastructure
 for a small manufacturing company. In this case, the company roasts,
 packages and sells delicious, freshly roasted coffee beans. Along the way, you learn how
 the InterSystems IRIS data platform can serve as the backbone of your IT architecture.</p>

    <p>It&apos;s divided into three parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://gettingstarted.intersystems.com/full-stack/full-stack-part-one/" target="_new">part 1</a>: create database tables and write raw coffee bean deliveries to the database.</li>
      <li><a href="https://gettingstarted.intersystems.com/full-stack/part-two-rest-services/" target="_new">part 2</a>: build web services that power the roasting operations and online store.</li>
      <li><a href="https://gettingstarted.intersystems.com/full-stack/part-three-front-end/" target="_new">part 3</a>: build a web storefront in Vue.js (results in this web app!)</li>
    </ol>
